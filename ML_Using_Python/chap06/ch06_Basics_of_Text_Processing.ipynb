    "Deep learning for natural language processing is pattern recognition applied to textual data. Textual data has to be first processed before one can apply machine learning techniques. Typically, the text is broken down either into characters or words or $n$-grams. An $n$-gram is a consecutive sequence of $n$ characters or words that appears in the text. The units into which textual data is broken down (either characters or words or $n$-grams) are called _units_."

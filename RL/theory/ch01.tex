\chapter{Markov Decision Processes}

\section{Introduction}

Problems in reinforcement learning are typically formulated in the formal
setting of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). An MDP is a five-tuple
$\angular{\states, \actions, p, \rewards, \discount}$
\begin{itemize}
    \item a set $\states$ of states
    \item a set $\actions$ of actions
    \item a set $\rewards$ of rewards
    \item a probability function
        $p \colon \states \times \rewards \times \states \times \actions \rightarrow [0, 1]$
    \item a discount factor $\discount \in [0, 1]$
\end{itemize}

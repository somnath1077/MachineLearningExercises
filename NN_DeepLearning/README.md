This repository contains theory and code examples from Nielsen's 
Neural Networks and Deep Learning book. The code examples were 
first copied verbatim from 

https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning.git

and then modified to Python 3.7.

The purpose of creating this repository is only for personal learning.

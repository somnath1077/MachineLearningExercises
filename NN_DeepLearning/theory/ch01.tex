\chapter{Using Neural Networks to Recognize Handwritten Digits}

\begin{exercise} Consider a network of perceptrons. Suppose that
we multiply all weights and biases by a positive constant $c > 0$. Show 
that the behaviour of the network does not change.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
First consider a single perceptron. 
\end{solution}

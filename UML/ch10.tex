\section{Notes}

The Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning guarantees that if a hypothesis
class has finite VC-dimension~$d$, the ERM algorithm will be able to
learn it with a sample of size $\Omega(\frac{d + \log (1 / \delta)}{\epsilon})$
in the realizable setting, and $\Omega(\frac{d + \log (1 /
\delta)}{\epsilon^2})$ in the agnostic setting. From the statistical
perspective, there is \emph{no} difference between the realizable and agnostic
setting. Learning is solely determined by the VC-dimension of the hypothesis
class.

However the computational complexity of implementing the ERM algorithm varies
widely between these two settings. Implementing the ERM algorithm for learning
Boolean conjunctions or the class of axis-aligned rectangles can be efficiently
done (as in polynomial time in the input size) in the realizable case; however,
these problems are NP-hard in the agnostic case. Since the notion of
PAC-learning (in the realizable setting) deals with being able to approximate
the true hypothesis with arbitrary accuracy, it makes sense to ask when
learning is computationally feasible if we drop this requirement and consider
classifiers that are just slightly better than making a random guess.  This
leads us to the notion of $\gamma$-weak-learnability.
